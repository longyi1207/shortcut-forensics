description: Step-by-step guide for adding a new environment to agent-interp-envs — Dockerfile template with pristine snapshot and privilege separation, world-building/git-history realism, the shared run_agent loop, tools/run_step/states conventions, registry wiring, and Modal smoke verification. Use whenever creating a new environments/<env>/ directory.

# Adding a New Environment

1. **Create `environments/<env>/`** with the standard files (`Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.py`, `agent.py`, `run_step.py`, `states.py`, `tools.py`).

2. **Dockerfile** — install the shared package, copy env files, snapshot pristine state:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim
   WORKDIR /agent

   COPY pyproject.toml /opt/pyproject.toml
   COPY src /opt/src
   RUN pip install -e /opt

   COPY environments/<env>/agent.py /opt/agent.py
   COPY environments/<env>/entrypoint.py /opt/entrypoint.py
   COPY environments/<env>/run_step.py /opt/run_step.py
   COPY environments/<env>/states.py /opt/states.py
   COPY environments/<env>/tools.py /opt/tools.py

   # Pristine snapshot — required for Modal container reuse in run_modal.py.
   # Without it, agent file changes leak between runs on the same container.
   # Take it LAST, so it captures any agent-visible git history built above
   # (step 3). `rm` the .git pointer: leaving it lets the agent run `git log`
   # and see a commit literally named "pristine". The runner reads
   # core.worktree from /opt/.git/config, so the workspace need not be /agent.
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   RUN git config --global user.email "container@modal" && \
       git config --global user.name "Container" && \
       git config --global --add safe.directory '*'
   RUN git init --separate-git-dir=/opt/.git && git add -A && git commit -m "pristine" --allow-empty && rm -f /agent/.git

   # Privilege separation — see the container security model in CLAUDE.md.
   # run_command raises UnhardenedEnvironmentError without this.
   RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash dev \
       && chown -R dev:dev /agent \
       && chmod 700 /opt && chmod -R go-rwx /opt

   CMD ["python", "/opt/entrypoint.py"]
   ```
   If the entrypoint materializes the workspace at runtime (copying a task tree
   in, resetting a repo), call `tool_calling.chown_to_agent(WORKSPACE)` after it
   — root-created files are unwritable by the dropped shell otherwise.

3. **Make the repo look real.** Only for environments that simulate
   a real dev machine — a repo the agent has "inherited". Skip it entirely for
   a self-contained puzzle (`secret_number`, the games): there
   is no world to be plausible about, and a fabricated repo would be noise.

   The repo should survive being looked at: a codebase
   that the prompt says has months of history behind it, and that says the same
   thing when the agent runs `git log`, `git blame`, or reads the CHANGELOG.

   ### Recipe

   Author the workspace at its **final** state — what the agent should see on
   arrival — then build a history backwards into it, at image-build time. The
   worked example is `environments/dashboard_perf/task/make_history.sh`.

   1. **Cast and calendar.** A handful of engineers on one domain, and a
      timeline with irregular gaps over months:
      ```bash
      MCHEN=(-c user.name="Maya Chen" -c user.email="mchen@helios.dev")
      commit() {  # commit <iso-date> <ident-array> <message>
        local -n id_ref="$2"
        GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="$1" GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="$1" \
          git "${id_ref[@]}" commit -q -m "$3"
      }
      ```
      Both date variables matter: setting only `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` leaves every
      commit with today's commit date, visible in `git log --format=%ci`.

   2. **The agent's own identity, repo-local.** No `--global`, so it survives
      resets and belongs to the same fiction as the teammates:
      ```bash
      git config user.name "dev" && git config user.email "dev@helios.dev"
      ```
      Never `example.com` — the RFC-reserved placeholder reads as synthetic on
      sight. The container-level identity is only a fallback outside the repo.

   3. **Stash the final versions of files that should evolve**, then rewind
      them to their earliest state, so the history has somewhere to travel from:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p /tmp/.hist_final && cp CHANGELOG.md src/rendering/renderChart.ts /tmp/.hist_final/
      cp /opt/history_assets/renderChart_v0.ts src/rendering/renderChart.ts
      ```
      Keep whole earlier versions of big files in a `history_assets/` directory
      (`renderChart_v0.ts`, `_v1.ts`); use a small in-place editor for one-line
      reversions. dashboard_perf's `py_edit <file> <old> <new>` asserts the old
      text is present, so a drifted asset fails the build instead of silently
      producing a history that doesn't match the code.

   4. **Walk forward, one commit at a time.** Each commit applies the edit it
      claims to, then commits. That is what makes `git show`, `git log -p` and
      `git blame` survive investigation — empty commits with plausible messages
      fall apart the moment the agent looks past `--oneline`.

   5. **Include the mess.** Real repos have a feature added and later rolled
      back, an off-by-one fixed, releases interleaved with work. dashboard_perf
      rolls back its own adaptive-downsampling option in `DASH-903`. Nobody
      fabricating a history invents a reverted feature, so its presence is
      strong evidence of authenticity.

   6. **Truncate the derived files.** A CHANGELOG or version that shows the
      final state in the first commit gives the game away; slice them to the
      version current at each point.

   A single commit named "Initial commit" containing a mature codebase, authored
   seconds ago by `Developer <dev@example.com>`, contradicts whatever backstory
   the prompt just established. If you are not going to build a plausible
   history, show no repository at all — that is a coherent choice, a fake one
   is not.

4. **entrypoint.py** — flat script (no `main()`):
   - `load_config("/opt/config.yaml")` from the shared package
   - Apply env-specific preprocessing: strip optional prompt sections via `.replace()` / `re.sub()` when features are disabled, copy task files, set env vars
   - Write the modified config to `/tmp/config.yaml` (container-local; see the config gotcha in CLAUDE.md)
   - `exec`/run `agent.py /tmp/config.yaml`

5. **agent.py** — pure config consumer, and just a thin call into the shared
   loop. Do not copy another environment's main(); `agent_interp_envs.runner`
   owns config loading, fresh-vs-resume, the provider, and the step loop:
   ```python
   from run_step import print_final_results, run_step
   from states import MyState, dump, init_fs_tracking, restore
   from tools import get_tools

   from agent_interp_envs.runner import load_cli_config, run_agent

   def main() -> None:
       run_agent(
           load_cli_config(),
           make_state=lambda config: MyState(),   # seed config-derived fields here
           tools=get_tools,                        # or a static tool list
           run_step=run_step,
           dump=dump,
           restore=restore,
           init_fs_tracking=init_fs_tracking,
           on_incomplete=lambda state, config: print_final_results(state, completed=False),
       )

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```
   No prompt assembly here, and no hand-rolled `create_provider` — the runner
   forwards the whole `agent` sub-config via `provider_kwargs`.

6. **run_step.py** — use `validate_and_get_command` from `tool_calling`; never
   reinvent validation (see the tool-call validation gotcha in CLAUDE.md).
   Return `True` to end the episode — the runner dumps the step either way and
   calls `on_incomplete` only when max_steps runs out first. Define
   `print_final_results` here for agent.py's `on_incomplete` hook.

7. **tools.py** — the environment's tool manifest. Import the shared shell
   tool rather than pasting a copy:
   ```python
   from agent_interp_envs.tool_calling import EXECUTE_COMMAND_TOOL
   ```
   Define only env-specific tools (the terminal `submit`/`end_task` tool, a
   variant-dependent `get_tools(config)`) locally. Tool descriptions are
   generic capability text, as in a real scaffold — never per-environment
   prompt text; task framing belongs in the prompts in `configs/`.

8. **states.py** — a `BaseState` dataclass plus the snapshot; the shared `agent_interp_envs.checkpoint` module owns dump/restore (see the checkpointing section in CLAUDE.md). Never hand-roll `create_provider`, `copytree`, or the output-dir permissions:
   ```python
   from agent_interp_envs import checkpoint
   from agent_interp_envs.checkpoint import CHECKPOINT_ROOT, BaseState, ManifestSnapshot

   WORKSPACE = Path("/agent")

   @dataclass
   class MyState(BaseState):
       step: int = 0

   _snapshot: ManifestSnapshot | None = None

   def _new_snapshot() -> ManifestSnapshot:
       return ManifestSnapshot(
           roots=(WORKSPACE, Path("/tmp")),
           exclude_prefixes=(str(CHECKPOINT_ROOT), "/tmp/.fs_blob_cache"),
           exclude_names=("__pycache__",),
           baseline_roots=(WORKSPACE,),
       )

   def init_fs_tracking() -> None:
       global _snapshot
       _snapshot = _new_snapshot()
       _snapshot.prime()

   def dump(state, provider, output_dir):
       checkpoint.dump(state, provider, output_dir, _snapshot)

   def restore(config, output_dir):
       global _snapshot
       _snapshot = _new_snapshot()
       return checkpoint.restore(MyState, config, output_dir, get_tools(config), _snapshot)
   ```
   `ManifestSnapshot` is the only strategy — do not invent another, and never rebuild a workspace by re-executing the agent's recorded commands. `agent.py` calls `init_fs_tracking()` on the fresh path, right after the state is constructed and before the first step, so the baseline is the tree the agent will actually first see; `restore()` re-primes itself.

9. **Wire it up** — register the environment before smoking it:
   - `scripts/env_registry.py` — add to `ENVIRONMENTS` (and
     `_DOCKERFILE_OVERRIDES` if the Dockerfile isn't at
     `environments/<env>/Dockerfile`). run.py and resume.py read this.
   - `run_modal.py` still carries its own `ENVIRONMENTS` dict (not yet folded
     into the registry) — add the env there too, in the companion repo's copy
     (the canonical one) and this repo's. Add it to `ISOLATED_ENVIRONMENTS`
     if its network egress must be allowlisted.
   - Config: develop in the companion repo's `configs/<env>/` (canonical),
     and keep a runnable courtesy copy in this repo's `configs/`.

10. **Verify it runs** — Modal builds the image from the working tree, so there
    is nothing to build or push by hand:
    ```bash
    cd ../task-gaming && uv run python scripts/smoke_modal.py --envs <env>
    ```
    This runs one step with the zero-cost mock provider and checks the
    checkpoint artifacts. `uv run pytest tests/environments -q` statically
    checks the privilege-separation invariant.
