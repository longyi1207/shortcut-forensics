# The agent LOOP (agent.py) runs as root so it can read /opt and hold the API
# key. The agent's SHELL must not. When a non-root `dev` user exists and
# hardening is on, each command runs with a sanitized environment (no API keys /
# harness paths), and — if this process is root (euid==0) — is additionally
# dropped to `dev`. Sanitizing the env is decoupled from the uid drop so the
# shell stays key-free even in arms where the agent LOOP itself runs unprivileged
# (e.g. coding read_only_tests, where agent.py is uid 1000 so euid!=0 and setuid
# is impossible, but the shell must still not inherit the loop's API keys).
# When no `dev` user exists, or the caller passes hardened=False, execution falls
# back to the historical behavior (current user, full inherited environment) so
# nothing breaks in envs whose Dockerfile has not yet added `dev`, and so it is a
# no-op on this (dev-less) host.
