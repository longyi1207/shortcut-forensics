"""Shared checkpoint machinery for the environments' `states.py` modules.

Every environment checkpoints the same three things after each step: the
conversation (`messages.json`), the environment state (`state.json`), and
whatever filesystem state a resume needs. This module owns that path so the
environments do not each hand-roll it — the drift between hand-rolled copies is
what produced a dropped `reasoning_effort` on resume in half the environments, a
wrong `create_provider` kwarg, and `copytree` crashes on stale read-only files.

The pieces, in the order an environment uses them:

* `BaseState` — a mixin for the state dataclass: `to_json`/`from_json`, a
  `COMPUTED` hook for derived fields that exist only in the dumped artifact, and
  tolerance for keys written by an older version of the environment.
* `restore_provider()` — one `create_provider` call for all environments, fed
  the whole `agent` sub-config rather than an enumerated kwarg list.
* `dump()` / `restore()` — the universal prologue and epilogue.
* `WorkspaceSnapshot` — the filesystem half of a checkpoint. There is one
  strategy, `ManifestSnapshot`, plus `GitPatchSnapshot` for the single
  environment whose diff is the deliverable rather than the snapshot
  (`swe_rebench_v2`). The earlier zoo — NullSnapshot (restored nothing),
  FileSetSnapshot (restored an enumerated list), TreeSnapshot (copied a whole
  directory) and the per-environment command REPLAY — is gone: each of them
  silently lost some subset of what the agent had written.

Checkpoints are private to the harness by default: the run output directory is
chmod 0700, because `state.json` routinely carries ground truth (expected
answers, grading flags) and `messages.json` carries the whole transcript
including the system prompt. See `make_private`.

# it is running under Modal, local Docker, or a test.
#
# Local Docker bind-mounts the run's host folder onto the default, so it sets

# point is fixed when the function is defined), so it points this straight at

    The loop runs as root, writes the checkpoints, and is their only reader; the
    agent never needs them — they hold per-step ground truth and the full
    transcript.

    Checkpoints live under `/opt`, which every image locks to root, so they are
    already unreachable from the agent's shell by construction. This mode is
    defence in depth: on Modal the real storage is the results volume at
    `/mnt/results`, which `/opt/output` only symlinks into, and a mount is not
    covered by the `/opt` lock.

    On Modal `/opt/output` is a symlink to the run directory on the results
    volume. `chmod` follows symlinks anyway; we resolve first so the mode
    provably lands on the real directory and any error names it.

    Ownership is deliberately left alone. For a local `docker run -v
    ./results:/opt/output` the directory belongs to the invoking user on the
    host, and chowning it to root inside the container would make the run's
    results unreadable outside it. The mode is sufficient: the only uid that
    shares the directory's owner is the loop itself.

    Never raises — a checkpoint that cannot be locked is still worth writing, so
    a failure warns and the dump continues.

    The one snapshot strategy. After every step it walks `roots`, detects the
    files the step's command touched (mtime/size/mode gate, then content copy),
    and writes the CUMULATIVE set of divergences from the baseline as
    `<checkpoint>/<name>/{manifest.json,blobs/}`. Restore applies that manifest
    over the pristine tree the entrypoint already rebuilt: byte-exact, `/tmp`
    and `.git` included, nothing re-executed.

    Lifecycle: `prime()` once the workspace is in the state the agent will first
    see (after the entrypoint's setup, or after a restore — `restore()` re-primes
    itself), then `save()` per step.

    Ownership and mode are recorded PER ENTRY and restored verbatim. That is not
    a detail: in several environments ownership is the enforcement mechanism,
    not incidental bookkeeping (coding's `read_only_tests` arm keeps `/agent`
    root-owned 0755 with only `solution.py` dev-owned — which is what stops
    `sed -i` renaming over the test file — and secret_number's `/secrets` modes
    are the exposure under study). A snapshot that chowned the restored tree to
    the agent's user would leave those rollouts running, and measuring something
    else. Files the agent created were agent-owned when they were dumped, so
    they come back agent-owned with no help needed; files the ENTRYPOINT staged
    as root are part of the pristine baseline rather than manifest entries, and
    the entrypoint (which runs on the resume path too) hands them over itself.

    `baseline_roots` closes the strategy's one sharp edge. The manifest is only
    meaningful against the baseline it was recorded from; applying it to a
    different pristine tree (a different task arm, a rebuilt image) yields a
    workspace that matches neither. Name the paths whose CONTENT identifies the
    pristine tree — normally just the workspace — and a digest of them is taken
    at `prime()`, recorded in the manifest, and re-checked at restore, before
    anything is applied. Both of those moments see a pristine tree, which is why
    the digest is taken at prime rather than at save: by save time the agent has
    edited the workspace (and possibly committed, which is what makes a live
    `HEAD` sha a trap). `.git` is skipped inside the digest — a repo the
    entrypoint creates at container start has per-run timestamps and a fresh
    commit sha for a byte-identical worktree.
