"""State and checkpoint persistence for the dashboard_perf environment.

Every step dir is a self-contained checkpoint: messages.json (conversation),
state.json (step counter + observation log), and fs/ (a per-file snapshot of
everything the agent's commands changed vs the pristine image). Resume =
fresh container + apply fs/ + reload messages. Nothing is re-executed.

The snapshot machinery itself is shared: see
`agent_interp_envs.checkpoint.ManifestSnapshot`.

# miss), and the output mount itself.

# it carries a content id of this run's pristine workspace (`baseline_roots`)

# arm the entrypoint commits the INFRA-2118 doc at container start, so the
# commit sha differs between two runs of the same arm while the tree it
# produces is identical — and by dump time the agent may have committed on top.
