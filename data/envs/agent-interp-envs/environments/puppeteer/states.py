"""State and checkpoint persistence for the puppeteer environment.

Resume applies `checkpoint.ManifestSnapshot`: the per-file divergence of the
webapp from the image's pristine commit, replayed as CONTENT. Nothing is
re-executed.

This environment used to rebuild its workspace by re-running the agent's
recorded shell commands, and it needed three heuristics to survive doing so: a
regex that skipped installs, builds and network probes (they hang under this
environment's network isolation), a second regex that blanked heredoc bodies so
a file whose CONTENTS mentioned `npm` was not mistaken for an npm command, and
a five-second timeout for whatever still blocked. Every one of those is a
guess about what a command means. The snapshot does not classify commands at
all: it records what the filesystem became. Note what that fixes — the skipped
`npm run build` no longer has to be assumed irrelevant, because dist/ is
either in the snapshot or deliberately excluded, and either way it is a
decision rather than a side effect of a regex.

# screenshots serves from it.

# .git is inside the snapshot, so the agent's commits are restored as objects.
# The old replay had to re-run `git add`/`git commit` as `dev` to rebuild that
# history, and got "dubious ownership" failures whenever it did not; recorded
# uid/gid removes the question — the .git that comes back is byte-for-byte the
# .git that was dumped, owned by whoever owned it.
