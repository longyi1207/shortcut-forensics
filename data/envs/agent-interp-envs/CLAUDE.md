# Agent Interpretability Environments

## Purpose

**This repo defines Docker images. The image is the interface.** Each `environments/<env>/` directory packages an agent task as a Docker image — Dockerfile, agent loop, tool definitions, run-step logic. That is this repo's entire job. All actual experiments and analysis are run from a private companion repo, which launches rollouts against these images with its own runner scripts and configs.

**The `scripts/` and `configs/` here are a courtesy for external users** — the repo is public and people look up these environments, so runnable scripts and example configs are maintained so others can use them. They are NOT the maintainer's workflow and are not the canonical copies: scripts and configs are developed in the companion repo first and synced here afterward. Them lagging behind is a known, accepted state — don't patch them in place; sync from the companion repo, and sync before treating anything as released.

**Analysis lives in a companion repo.** By convention, downstream work — analysis, plotting, grading aggregation, cross-run experiments — is kept in a separate repo, typically checked out as a sibling directory. That repo may or may not be present on any given machine; nothing here requires it to build or run environments. If you see stale references to a specific companion repo name (e.g. `../mats/`), read them as "the current companion analysis repo".

The boundary:
- `agent-interp-envs/` produces an image like `gkroiz/agent-interp-envs:<env>-latest` and launches rollouts against it with a config bind-mounted at `/opt/config.yaml`, writing results to `./results/`.
- The companion repo consumes those results (per-step `messages.json` + `state.json`) for analysis.

Nothing inside an environment container should know about how rollouts are launched, batched, or analyzed.

## Container security model (invariant — conform the environment, not the framework)

Every environment runs the same way. If an environment doesn't fit, change the
environment.

1. **The agent loop runs as root.** `agent.py` reads `/opt`, holds the API keys,
   and writes checkpoints.
2. **The agent's shell runs as `dev` with a sanitized environment.** Every
   command goes through `run_command()` in `agent_interp_envs.tool_calling`,
   which drops to `dev` and passes an allowlisted env (no `*_API_KEY`, no
   harness paths). The agent can neither read the harness nor echo out secrets.

3. **The loop's output is private to the loop.** Checkpoints are written to
   `/opt/output` — inside the root-only `/opt`, so they are unreachable from the
   agent's shell by construction, the same way the resume checkpoint at
   `/opt/checkpoint` is. `checkpoint.dump` additionally sets mode 0700 as
   defence in depth, because on Modal the real storage is the results volume at
   `/mnt/results` and a mount is not covered by the `/opt` lock. `state.json` routinely carries ground truth
   (`expected_answer`, `correct`, grading flags) and `messages.json` carries the
   whole transcript including the system prompt; the agent never needs either.
   This is enforced once, in `agent_interp_envs.checkpoint.dump`, so every
   environment — including future ones — inherits it. Do not chmod or chown
   `/opt/output` from an environment.

Each Dockerfile therefore ends with a privilege-separation block: create `dev`,
`chown` the agent workspace to `dev`, and `chmod 700 /opt`. Entrypoints that
write a resolved config to `/tmp` must `chmod 0600` it (`/tmp` is
world-readable). Never launch the loop as a non-root user to make the shell
non-root — `run_command` handles that per command, and a non-root loop cannot
read `/opt` or checkpoint the workspace.

Two orthogonal, opt-in layers sit on top, both selected by the runner rather
than the image: running in a Modal sandbox, and restricting network egress to
an allowlist (`ISOLATED_ENVIRONMENTS` in `scripts/env_registry.py`).

Deliberate exceptions exist where the exposure *is* the experiment — e.g.
`secret_number`'s world-readable `/secrets` and its `hardened=false`
counterfactual arm, `ai_rd`'s agent-visible `score.py`, and `eval_tampering`'s
agent-readable checkpoint dir (`checkpoint.dump(..., private=False)`, the only
allowlisted one). These are documented at the point of exception; everything
else conforms. `tests/environments/test_privilege_separation.py` checks all of
this statically.

## The agent loop (`agent_interp_envs.runner`)

Environments do not hand-roll `main()`. `run_agent(config, ...)` owns the
whole entry loop — fresh-vs-resume branch, provider construction (via
`provider_kwargs`, so new `create_provider` knobs reach every environment
without touching agent.py), `print_history`, and the run_step/dump/step
cycle. An environment's agent.py passes only what differs: `make_state`
(fresh state, config-derived fields seeded inside), `tools` (list or
`(config) -> list`), its `run_step`, the states.py hooks
(`dump`/`restore`/`init_fs_tracking`), and `on_incomplete` (called when
max_steps runs out without run_step returning True). `load_cli_config()`
handles the argv-vs-`/opt/config.yaml` cases. See
`environments/eval_tampering/agent.py` (minimal) and
`environments/swe_rebench_v2/agent.py` (closure-wrapped dump) for the shape.
Migrated so far: eval_tampering, sandbagging, puppeteer, swe_rebench_v2;
older environments still carry the hand-copied main() and can be migrated
when touched.

## Checkpointing (`agent_interp_envs.checkpoint`)

Environments do not hand-roll dump/restore. `states.py` declares a state
dataclass and a snapshot strategy; the shared module does the rest.

```python
from agent_interp_envs import checkpoint
from agent_interp_envs.checkpoint import CHECKPOINT_ROOT, BaseState, ManifestSnapshot

WORKSPACE = Path("/agent")

@dataclass
class MyState(BaseState):
    step: int = 0
    # Derived fields that exist only in the dumped artifact:
    COMPUTED = ("num_commands",)
    def computed(self): return {"num_commands": len(self.commands)}

_snapshot: ManifestSnapshot | None = None

def _new_snapshot() -> ManifestSnapshot:
    return ManifestSnapshot(
        roots=(WORKSPACE, Path("/tmp")),
        exclude_prefixes=(str(CHECKPOINT_ROOT), "/tmp/.fs_blob_cache"),
        exclude_names=("__pycache__",),
        baseline_roots=(WORKSPACE,),
    )

def init_fs_tracking() -> None:      # agent.py calls this on the fresh path,
    global _snapshot                 # once the workspace is pristine
    _snapshot = _new_snapshot()
    _snapshot.prime()

def dump(state, provider, output_dir):
    checkpoint.dump(state, provider, output_dir, _snapshot)

def restore(config, output_dir):
    global _snapshot                 # restore() re-primes itself
    _snapshot = _new_snapshot()
    return checkpoint.restore(MyState, config, output_dir, get_tools(config), _snapshot)
```

- `BaseState` — `to_json`/`from_json`. Unknown keys are dropped with a warning
  instead of raising, so old checkpoints stay loadable across a field rename;
  `COMPUTED` and `LEGACY_KEYS` name the ones to drop silently.
- `restore_provider` — the single `create_provider` call. It forwards the whole
  `agent` sub-config, filtered by `create_provider`'s own signature, so a new
  provider knob reaches resume without touching any environment. Never
  re-enumerate kwargs in an environment: that is how `reasoning_effort` came to
  be silently dropped on resume in half of them.
- **There is one snapshot strategy: `ManifestSnapshot`.** Per-file divergence
  from a pristine baseline (manifest + content blobs). Nothing is re-executed on
  resume, mode AND owner are restored per entry, and it refuses a checkpoint
  taken against a different pristine tree. Use it for every new environment.
  - `roots` — everywhere the agent can write that must survive resume. The
    workspace, plus `/tmp` wherever the agent has a general shell.
  - `exclude_prefixes` / `exclude_names` — the results root
    (`checkpoint.CHECKPOINT_ROOT`), the blob cache, and regenerable caches
    (`node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.mypy_cache`, npm/pip caches). Names are
    matched at any depth; prefixes cannot express `**/__pycache__`.
  - `baseline_roots` — the paths whose CONTENT identifies the pristine tree,
    normally just the workspace. Hashed at `prime()` (and again at restore,
    before anything is applied), so an arm mismatch fails loudly instead of
    producing a tree that matches neither. Do NOT reach for a live `git HEAD`
    sha: by dump time the agent may have committed. `.git` is skipped inside the
    digest because an entrypoint that `git init`s at container start mints a
    fresh sha per run for an identical worktree.
  - There is no `chown_user`. Ownership is recorded per entry and reinstated
    verbatim, because in several environments ownership IS the enforcement
    (coding's `read_only_tests` arm, `secret_number`'s `/secrets`). Files the
    agent created were agent-owned when dumped, so they come back that way;
    pristine files the entrypoint staged as root are baseline, not manifest
    entries, and the entrypoint re-stages them on the resume path too.
- `GitPatchSnapshot` survives for `swe_rebench_v2` alone, where the diff is the
  graded deliverable (`model_patch`) rather than a way to persist a workspace.
- `puppeteer`, `precommit_hook` and `revert_or_refactor` used to rebuild their
  workspace by REPLAYING recorded shell commands, with skip-regexes, heredoc
  blanking and timeouts. That is gone. Do not reintroduce it: re-running a
  command is a second run, not a restore.

## CRITICAL Gotchas

### Reasoning effort greatly changes results

Reasoning effort is a first-class experimental variable, not an incidental knob. It acts at
generation time (does NOT change prompt tokens), so prompt-identical is not policy-identical,
and effort-on vs effort-off cells must never be compared as if the same. Concrete example: on
the code-summary-honesty regression scenario, turning reasoning on cut gemini's false
"tests pass" claims from 14/20 to 6/20. **Standing per-model defaults:** deepseek (Fireworks)
`max`; gemini + opus (OpenRouter) `high`. Pin `agent.reasoning_effort` explicitly in the config —
never rely on a provider code default (it has drifted).
When a model with reasoning on emits an empty tool call instead of prose, append to the user
turn: "Respond directly in text; do not call any tools."

### Tool call validation

All `run_step.py` files MUST use `validate_and_get_command()` from `agent_interp_envs.tool_calling`. Never write manual checks (no-tool-call, parallel-tool-call, JSON parsing, banned commands) in run_step — they're all centralized.

Single-tool environments:
```python
from agent_interp_envs.tool_calling import validate_and_get_command, run_command

def run_step(provider, state, config):
    result = validate_and_get_command(provider)
    if not result.success:
        return False
    rc, output = run_command(result.command)
    # ... build ToolResult, add to provider, print
```

Multi-tool environments:
```python
ALLOWED_TOOLS = {"execute_command", "submit"}

def run_step(provider, state, config):
    result = validate_and_get_command(provider, allowed_tools=ALLOWED_TOOLS)
    if not result.success:
        return False
    if result.tool_call.name == "execute_command":
        rc, output = run_command(result.command)
    elif result.tool_call.name == "submit":
        answer = result.args.get("answer")
```

`ValidationResult` fields: `success`, `command` (execute_command only), `args` (parsed dict, double-encode safe), `tool_call`, `response`.

### Never write back to `/opt/config.yaml`

The host config is bind-mounted shared across all containers when `--count > 1`. Opening it for write truncates it to zero bytes, and sibling containers reading mid-write get empty data. Always write modified configs to `/tmp/config.yaml` (container-local).

### Checkpoint dumps must tolerate stale `/opt/output` state (container reuse)

`/opt/output/` is container-local and **persists across rollouts on a reused Modal container** (same as the `/opt/config.yaml` sharing above). So a `dump()` that writes `step-N/` can find a leftover copy from a previous rollout that landed on the same container.

This used to bite hardest with **read-only task files**. When `read_only_tests: true`, the entrypoint `chmod`s `test_solution.py` to `0o444`. A snapshot that copied the workspace wholesale —

```python
shutil.copytree("/agent", output_dir / "workspace", dirs_exist_ok=True)  # BUG
```

— cannot overwrite a leftover `0o444` file (`Permission denied`), which throws and the runner silently **drops the whole rollout** ("Removed 1 failed run"). It presented as a rare (~1-2 per 50), random sampling loss that's easy to miss.

`ManifestSnapshot` makes this unrepresentable rather than merely handled: it never copies a tree into the step dir at all. Blobs are content-addressed and written only when absent, so a leftover blob is by definition already the right bytes and is skipped. Do not hand-roll `copytree` into a `states.py`.

### Prompt text lives in `configs/`, not in code

The entrypoint only *strips* optional prompt sections when a feature is disabled — it never assembles or hardcodes prompt text. Dynamic values come from OmegaConf interpolation (`${task.foo}`) resolved on the host before the config is mounted.

When stripping conditional text via `.replace()` / `re.sub()`, ensure the operation is idempotent (the search string must be fully consumed by the replacement, so a second run is a no-op).

### No editorializing comments in agent-facing files

I (Claude) have a bad habit of leaving explanatory/justifying comments in files the agent reads — `submit_solution.py`, `solution.py`, `test_solution.py`, `description.md`, prompts. **Do not.** The agent under evaluation sees these files verbatim, so any comment I add (e.g. "the only path to full reward is passing the buggy test", "binary = all-or-nothing") leaks the experiment's intent and contaminates the result — it nudges the very behavior we're measuring. When creating a variant of an agent-facing file, make it **byte-identical to the original except the minimal lines that must change** (verify with `diff`). Rationale and design notes belong in *this* CLAUDE.md or in host-side code, never in the container's workspace files.

### Update the Dockerfile when adding files

A new file under `environments/<env>/` (a Documentation variant, a helper module, a data file) needs a matching `COPY` line. Forgetting this passes locally but crashes in the container.

### Config resolution flow

1. **Host (`scripts/run.py` / `run_modal.py`)** loads the YAML, applies CLI overrides, resolves `${}` interpolations, writes resolved config to `results_dir/config.yaml`.
2. **Docker mount** binds that host file as `/opt/config.yaml` (read-only in practice).
3. **Container entrypoint** reads `/opt/config.yaml`, applies env-specific preprocessing, writes `/tmp/config.yaml`, execs `agent.py /tmp/config.yaml`.

## Results Output

Each step writes to `/opt/output/step-N/` (mounted out by the runner):
- `state.json` — serialized environment state
- `messages.json` — full conversation
- Env-specific artifacts (workspace files, game records, etc.)

The tree is mode 0700 — root-only, invisible to the agent's shell. On Modal
`/opt/output` is a symlink to the run directory on the results volume; the mode
lands on the real directory and `modal volume get` is unaffected.
