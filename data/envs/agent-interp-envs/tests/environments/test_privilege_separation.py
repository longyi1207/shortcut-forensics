"""Static conformance check for the container security model.

Every environment image must be able to honor the invariant enforced at runtime
by `agent_interp_envs.tool_calling.run_command`: the loop runs as root, the
agent's shell runs as `dev` with a sanitized environment. That requires each
Dockerfile to create `dev`, hand it the agent workspace, and lock `/opt`.

This is a source-level check, not a rollout: it costs milliseconds and scales to
any number of environments, so a new environment cannot silently ship a root
shell holding the API keys. See the security-model section in CLAUDE.md.
